This repository is the safe place where to keep scripts, utilities and snippets, written both for work and personal purposes, that solved (and eventually keep doing that) daily problems and/or handle common systems operations for me.

You know, all those things on which you spent too much time to be simply trashed and that, in the same time, don't deserve their own repository.
